# svelte-minimal
A minimal template to get you started with Svelte. It supports **hash-based routing** (thanks to [svelte-spa-router](https://github.com/ItalyPaleAle/svelte-spa-router)) and doesn't require any server-side processing.

## How to use it
```
npx degit vrde/svelte-minimal myapp
npm install
npm start
```

## How to make a production build
`npm run build`
